    "Many Python packages can be used for plotting data (including, but not limited to, Bokeh, Seaborn, ggplot, Plotly, $etc.$), but [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is probably the most popular. It is a hugely versatile package, allowing users to produce high-quality figures suitable for publication in journals, books, and theses. This computational workshop will introduce some of the functionality of the Matplotlib module, and builds upon your existing knowledge of the NumPy module,loop structures, and file input/output syntax within Python.\n",

Much of this material may be familiar to you from your previous CH160, CH273, and CH274 Python workshops. Section 3 onwards deals with more advanced plotting techniques, which allow you to generate more complicated plots."

There are many software packages which let you plot things (including Excel, Origin, and my personal favorite, Igor Pro), and I am certainly not going to claim that Matplotlib is the best - the learning curve is a little too steep and the syntax occasionally a little too convoluted - but if you want a free, operating system agnostic program capable of producing extremely high-quality plots (something Excel is <b>not</b> able to do), it is very hard to beat. \n",

As you have already learned, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is an excellent place to find answers about Matplotlib and Python in general.
